    "# Discuss string slicing and provide examples\n",
    "\n",
    "## String slicing is a technique used in Python to access a subset of a string by specifying a start and end index. This allows for extracting specific parts of the string efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for string slicing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "python \n",
    "\n",
    "string[start:end:step]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- start: The beginning index of the slice. If omitted, the default is the beginning of the string (0).\n",
    "- end: The ending index of the slice (exclusive). If omitted, the default is the end of the string.\n",
    "- step: The step value to determine the increment between each index for the slice. If omitted, the default is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Basic Slicing*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    example\n",
    "   \n",
    "   text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   slice1 = text[0:5]\n",
    "   print(slice1)  # Output: Hello\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the slice text[0:5] extracts characters from index 0 to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Omitting Start and End*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    example\n",
    "   \n",
    "   text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   slice2 = text[:5]\n",
    "   print(slice2)  # Output: Hello\n",
    "\n",
    "   slice3 = text[7:]\n",
    "   print(slice3)  # Output: World!\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   Omitting the start index defaults to 0, and omitting the end index defaults to the length of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Negative Indexing*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    example\n",
    "   \n",
    "   text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   slice4 = text[-6:]\n",
    "   print(slice4)  # Output: World!\n",
    "\n",
    "   slice5 = text[-6:-1]\n",
    "   print(slice5)  # Output: World\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   Negative indices count from the end of the string, with -1 being the last character.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Step Values*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    example\n",
    "   \n",
    "   text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   slice6 = text[::2]\n",
    "   print(slice6)  # Output: Hlo ol!\n",
    "\n",
    "   slice7 = text[1::2]\n",
    "   print(slice7)  # Output: el,Wrd\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   The step value determines the interval of indices to include in the slice. In text[::2], every second character is taken starting from the first character. In text[1::2], every second character is taken starting from the second character.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Reversing a String*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    example\n",
    "   \n",
    "   text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   reversed_text = text[::-1]\n",
    "   print(reversed_text)  # Output: !dlroW ,olleH\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   Using a negative step value (-1) reverses the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex Slicing Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Extracting a Substring*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    example\n",
    "   \n",
    "   text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n",
    "   substring = text[10:25]\n",
    "   print(substring)  # Output: brown fox jumps\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Skipping Characters*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    example\n",
    "   \n",
    "   text = \"abcdefg\"\n",
    "   skip_chars = text[1:6:2]\n",
    "   print(skip_chars)  # Output: bdf\n",

    "## Dictionaries in Python are mutable collections of key-value pairs, where keys are unique. They allow efficient access, addition, modification, and deletion of items. Here’s how you can perform these operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Items\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Add a Single Item*: You can add a new key-value pair by assigning a value to a new key.\n",
    "\n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "   my_dict[\"city\"] = \"New York\"\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Update Method*: Use the update() method to add multiple key-value pairs at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   my_dict.update({\"country\": \"USA\", \"occupation\": \"Engineer\"})\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York', 'country': 'USA', 'occupation': 'Engineer'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying Items\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Modify by Key*: Assign a new value to an existing key to modify its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   my_dict[\"age\"] = 26\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26, 'city': 'New York', 'country': 'USA', 'occupation': 'Engineer'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Update Method*: The update() method can also be used to modify values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   my_dict.update({\"age\": 27, \"city\": \"Los Angeles\"})\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 27, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'country': 'USA', 'occupation': 'Engineer'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting Items\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Remove by Key*: Use the del statement to remove an item by its key.\n",
    "\n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   del my_dict[\"country\"]\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 27, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'occupation': 'Engineer'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Pop Method*: The pop() method removes an item by key and returns its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   age = my_dict.pop(\"age\")\n",
    "   print(age)  # Output: 27\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'occupation': 'Engineer'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Popitem Method*: The popitem() method removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair. (In Python 3.7+ dictionaries maintain insertion order)\n",
    "\n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   last_item = my_dict.popitem()\n",
    "   print(last_item)  # Output: ('occupation', 'Engineer')\n",
    "   print(my_dict)   # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'Los Angeles'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Clear Method*: The clear() method removes all items from the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "   example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   my_dict.clear()\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {}\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Use\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Adding Items*:\n",
    "\n",
    "   example :\n",
    "    \n",
    "   user_info = {\"username\": \"johndoe\", \"email\": \"johndoe@example.com\"}\n",

    "   \n",
    "   user_info[\"age\"] = 30\n",
    "   user_info[\"country\"] = \"USA\"\n",
    "   print(user_info.popitem())  # Output: ('country', 'USA')\n",
    "   print(user_info)            # Output: {'username': 'johndoe', 'first_name': 'Jonathan', 'age': 30}\n",

    "#  Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionary keys in Python must be immutable, meaning their values cannot change. This requirement ensures that keys are hashable, allowing the dictionary to maintain a consistent mapping of keys to values. The immutability of keys is crucial for the efficiency and reliability of dictionaries. Here’s why this is important and some examples to illustrate the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Immutable Dictionary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Hashing and Consistency*: Dictionaries use a hash table to store key-value pairs. When a key is added to the dictionary, its hash value is computed and used to determine where to store the value. If the key were mutable and could change after being added, its hash value would also change, leading to inconsistencies and making it impossible to retrieve the value reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Performance*: Hashing allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions. Immutable keys ensure that the hash value remains constant, enabling the dictionary to quickly locate the associated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Data Integrity*: Immutable keys prevent accidental modification, ensuring that the dictionary's structure remains stable. This stability is critical for maintaining data integrity, especially in complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Immutable and Mutable Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Immutable Keys*: Examples include strings, numbers (integers, floats), and tuples (containing only immutable elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "   example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "    my_dict = {\n",
    "       \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "       42: \"Answer to the Ultimate Question\",\n",
    "       (1, 2): \"Coordinates\"\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   \n",
    "   print(my_dict[\"name\"])       # Output: Alice\n",
    "   print(my_dict[42])           # Output: Answer to the Ultimate Question\n",
    "   print(my_dict[(1, 2)])       # Output: Coordinates\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Immutability Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Hash Table Example*: Consider a dictionary where the keys are computed using a hash function. If a key could change, its hash value would also change, breaking the internal mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "   example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   my_dict = {\"key\": \"value\"}\n",
    "   # The key \"key\" has a hash value, say h.\n",
    "   # If \"key\" could change to \"new_key\", its hash would change to a different value, say h'.\n",
    "   # my_dict[h] would no longer point to \"value\".\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Tuple as a Key*: Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only immutable elements. This ensures that the tuple's hash value remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "   example :\n",
    "        \n",
    "   my_dict = {}\n",
    "   key = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   my_dict[key] = \"Tuple as a key\"\n",
    "   print(my_dict[key])  # Output: Tuple as a key\n",
    "\n",
    "   # If the tuple could change:\n",
    "   # key = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   # key[0] = 4  # This would change the hash and break the dictionary's internal mapping.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Immutable Key Example with Integers and Strings*:\n",
    "\n",
    "   example :\n",

    "       103: 22\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   print(student_ages[101])  # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "   capitals = {\n",
    "       \"USA\": \"Washington, D.C.\",\n",
    "       \"France\": \"Paris\",\n",
    "       \"Japan\": \"Tokyo\"\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   print(capitals[\"Japan\"])  # Output: Tokyo\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Complex Key Example with Tuples*:\n",
    "\n",
    "   example :\n",

    "   }\n",
    "   print(locations[(40.7128, -74.0060)])  # Output: New York\n",
